# BusStopTracker
## Description
Currently plays out Bus Stops between the MIT campus on a map, each second. The animation increases in speed with each tap of the button. But I am currently working on improvements to be made such as using data from another public API and changing the map style.

## How to Run: 
Render onto a page, and click the large button to watch the Bus Stops play out across the map.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
I hope I can make this in another city at a larger scale, including the buses' time schedules for utility if you were to hover your mouse over an marker.
